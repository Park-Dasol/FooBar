      "description": "It's time to start shedding your layers of winterwear and hit your internal defrost button with a refreshing, spring-inspired cocktail. Think sour citrus drinks to keep you cool as warmth spreads on the air, bubbly drinks to match your higher spirits, and bright colors, like the landscape waking up around you. After the elegant comfort of winter cocktails, and before the unabashed party spirit of summer cocktails, enjoy your springtime favorite!"

      "description": "All of the sudden, Old Fashioneds were being batched and served in styrofoam cups out of bar windows. Sometimes, they tasted pretty bad—too much orange, too much ice. Cutesy Capri Sun pouches from the restaurant around the corner hid tequila-spiked concoctions. Sometimes, they tasted damn good! And in the park, insulated Hydro Flasks sloshed out homemade rum punches that, well...they tasted like rum. This year, things are back on track, sort of. You're once again sitting at a bar, where a professional is making you a fancy-pants specialty cocktail with all the works. Outside the bar, you've been left to your own devices"

      "description": "The temperature is cooling down, the leaves are beginning to change colors, and all the fruity summer cocktails are leaving us too. Summer is gone and fall is here. Instead of locking yourself indoors, trying to hide from the change of seasons, go out, enjoy the cooling temperatures (because we all know you hated sweating through the humid, 100 degree weather we call summer), and take a look at all the new cocktail menus. As this fall season turns the corner, we see that bitters, herbs, and citrus juices are playing a big role on most cocktail menus."

      "description": "Keep the spirits high with a warming glass of cocktail. This time of year it's nice to settle down after a long day with a drink that will melt the chill out of your bones and melt away your cares. The sweet, comforting drink will warm you up on a chilly day, or when you're halfway down a ski slope.  Fire is warming. But a fireside Hot Toddy? That’ll melt even the coldest of winter wanderers."
