      "description": "All of the sudden, Old Fashioneds were being batched and served in styrofoam cups out of bar windows. Sometimes, they tasted pretty bad—too much orange, too much ice. Cutesy Capri Sun pouches from the restaurant around the corner hid tequila-spiked concoctions. Sometimes, they tasted damn good! And in the park, insulated Hydro Flasks sloshed out homemade rum punches that, well...they tasted like rum. This year, things are back on track, sort of. You're once again sitting at a bar, where a professional is making you a fancy-pants specialty cocktail with all the works. Outside the bar, you've been left to your own devices"

Instead of locking yourself indoors, trying to hide from the change of seasons, go out, enjoy the cooling temperatures (because we all know you hated sweating through the humid, 100 degree weather we call summer), and take a look at all the new cocktail menus. As this fall season turns the corner, we see that bitters, herbs, and citrus juices are playing a big role on most cocktail menus."
